The principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed from one form to another, which applies to processes involving the three states of matter: solids, liquids, and gases. For example, when heat energy is added to a solid, it can transform into a liquid and eventually into a gas, demonstrating energy transfer while maintaining the total energy.
